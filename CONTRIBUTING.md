# Contributing
We'd love to get your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Proposing new features
- Submitting a fix

## Proposing a change
In all cases, the first step should be to create an [issue](https://github.com/autotraderuk/oliver-twist/issues) to discuss the change that you want to make. This is where we can discuss the feature or bug at a high level and decide if/how we can implement it.
- If you're suggesting a feature, please provide us with a quick summary and some background on why you think the change would be beneficial.
- If you're submitting a bug report, please provide steps to reproduce and tell us what you expected to happen vs what actually happened.


## Submitting a change
If you have the ability to implement the change yourself, then we accept changes via [pull requests](https://github.com/autotraderuk/oliver-twist/pulls):
- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- Add tests as appropriate.
- If necessary, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Create a pull request!

Be sure to reference the issue in the pull request (using `#` followed by the issue number, such as `#5`).
